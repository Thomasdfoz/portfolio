            "longDescription": "Battle of Herone is a strategy game focused on tactical battles using cards to summon units and control the field. The entire project was created entirely by me: gameplay, card system, battle logic, economy, UI, maps, procedural art, internal tools, and Steam integration.\n\nThe multiplayer model is **asynchronous**, without real-time networking. Instead of direct connections between players, the game uses API + database to register states, send actions, process battle results, and maintain player progress. This format eliminates the need for dedicated servers and ensures fast, secure, and stable matches.\n\nTechnically, the project includes:\n- Complete card system (cost, rarity, attributes, effects, archetypes).\n- Fully original combat mechanics, with unit AI, movement, range, and target prioritization.\n- Deck management, progression, economy, and rewards.\n- Asynchronous backend via API, match control, result storage, and data persistence.\n- Internal tools in Unity for creating and balancing units.\n- Complete publication on Steamworks.\n\nIn my professional assessment, this project demonstrates total mastery of the essential layers of a commercial game: design, implementation, asynchronous multiplayer flow, content production, platform integration, and general stability. The natural next steps would be balancing telemetry, seasonal events, and content expansion (new factions, cards, and modes).",

On the backend, Supabase was chosen for the combination of PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time APIs, which allowed quickly implementing the complete POS flow — including login, product management, and sales structure.
